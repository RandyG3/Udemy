Dictionary
    An unordered data structure for declaring relationships between objects
    A mutable data structure consisting of pairs of keys and values
    A key is an object that serves as a unique identifier for a value
    A Value is any python object

Keys vs Values
    Keys are unique, values can be duplicates
    Keys must be immutable types (strings, integers, floats, tuples). Values
        can be any data type

Dictionaries vs Lists
    Both lists and dictionaries are mutable. A dictionary can have key-value
        pairs added, removed, or modified.
    Unlike a list, a dictionary is not ordered. A dictionary is used for
        mappings while a list is used for order.
