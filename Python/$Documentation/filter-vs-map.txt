As far as I can tell if you want to pull elements from the list and print a new list
using those elements you use filter. Whereas map you can pull elements and carry out
an operation on them and then print a new list with the results of the operation.

From Boris
That's basically it. filter to filter (subset) down the original list, map to return
a new list of the same size.
