Removing Elements from a List
delete_all.py
Quiz 25

The code I have below works fine for all the examples except all 4's. In that case I get an index error. 
I've tried several times to fix this one, but still get the error. Please help! Thanks in advance!!


    def delete_all(strings, target):
        i = 0
        while target in (strings):
            del strings[i]
            i += 1
     
        return strings

Hi Randy,

The while statement will return True if the target string is found anywhere in the string lists.

However, a True evaluation does not guarantee that the string you're looking for is necessarily found 
at the index currently represented by i.

Here's a simple example that will cause an error:

    values = ["a", "b"]
    delete_all(values, "b")
    print(values)

The while statement will return True but your code will delete the value at index position 0.

Is there a method you can think of on a list that will delete an element for you?

Hi Boris,
Thanks for the quick reply and explanation of the while statement.
What a difference a day makes! Took a fresh look at the methods and quite surprised how quickly I was able to complete the assignment!

Thanks!
Randy
